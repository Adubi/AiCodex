## Our Pledge

This project and everyone participating in it are governed by the AICodex Code of Conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## What should I know before I get started?

### Project Setup

If you haven't already, come say hi in our chat channel! Then read through our documentation here:

- README for setting up your development environment.
- Contributor Guide if you're not sure where to start or how to fit into the project.

### Community Guidelines

This project follows GitHub's Community Guidelines.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for AICodex. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

Before creating bug reports, please check this list as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible. Fill out the required template, the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

**Note:** If you find a Closed issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

#### Getting Started

To contribute to AICodex, follow these steps:

1. Create a new branch for your contribution.
2. Make your changes and ensure they follow the project's coding standards and guidelines.
3. Test your changes thoroughly.
4. Commit your changes with clear and descriptive commit messages.
5. Push your changes to your forked repository.
6. Submit a pull request to the `dev` branch of the original repository.

#### Commits

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should follow the principles below:

- Separate subject from body with a blank line
- Limit the subject line to 50 characters
- Capitalize the subject line
- Do not end the subject line with a period
- Use the imperative mood in the subject line
- Wrap the body at 72 characters
- Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

**Template:**

Save the template below into a text file so it becomes easy to follow the commit message style in git:

```
Subject Line (limit to 50 characters, imperative mood, no period)

<BLANK LINE>

Body Wrap at 72 characters
- Explain what and why vs. how
- Provide context or reasoning behind the changes
- Reference related issues or tasks if applicable
```

Use the code below to save it as a template for all your commit messages:

```
git config --global commit.template path/to/commitmsg.txt
```

### Submitting a Pull Request

When submitting a pull request, ensure the following:

- Your changes are isolated to a single feature or bug fix.
- Your code is well-documented, including inline comments where necessary.
- You have included tests for your changes, especially for new features.
- Your code passes all existing tests.
- You have updated relevant documentation if needed.

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

- Follow all instructions in the template.
- Follow the style guides.

#### Code Style and Guidelines

##### Tooling

- Python Version: Use Python 3.x for development.
- Virtual Environment: Create and activate a virtual environment for your development environment.
- Dependency Management: Use pip for installing project dependencies. Maintain dependencies in the `requirements/dev.txt` file.
- Linting: Ensure your code adheres to PEP 8 guidelines. You can use tools like Flake8 or Pylint for linting.

##### EditorConfig Settings for VSCode

To ensure consistency in coding style across contributors, use the following EditorConfig settings in Visual Studio Code (VSCode). If you haven't installed the EditorConfig plugin for VSCode, you can

 install it from the VSCode marketplace.

**.editorconfig:**

```
# EditorConfig helps maintain consistent coding styles across various editors and IDEs.
root = true

[*]
charset = utf-8
end_of_line = lf
indent_style = space
indent_size = 4
insert_final_newline = true
trim_trailing_whitespace = true

[*.py]
indent_size = 4
```

##### JavaScript Styleguide

All JavaScript must adhere to JavaScript Standard Style.

##### CSS Styleguide

- Use BEM (Block Element Modifier) notation.
- Avoid using IDs in selectors.
- Use hyphens in class names instead of camelCase or snake_case.
- Define styles in the component for which they are used instead of globally, when possible.

##### Documentation Styleguide

- Use Markdown.
- Reference methods and classes in markdown with the special syntax `[methodName](url-to-documentation)`.

#### Additional Notes

- If you want to contribute, please take a look at the issues on GitHub and look for any tagged with good first issue.
- If you plan to add new functionality, it would be great to chat about it before you get started, just to make sure it aligns with the goals of the project and avoids duplication of effort. This is not a requirement, but just a suggested path.
